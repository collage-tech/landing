                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Tokens/Credits; usage</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        Tokens/Credits are usage units that are consumed when you use paid functions (for example, generating an Output), as indicated in the Service interface. Token consumption per Effect/Module may vary and may change over time; the applicable rate is the one shown at the time you initiate the action. Tokens/Credits are non-transferable and have no cash value.

                        Each generation attempt (including re-runs) consumes Tokens/Credits at the rate shown in the Service interface at the time you initiate the action, regardless of whether you like the Output or whether it meets your expectations. Outputs may contain inaccuracies, artifacts, or other limitations inherent to AI. Except to the extent required by applicable law, dissatisfaction with an Output (including alleged "generation errors" that do not prevent delivery of an Output) does not entitle you to any free re-generation, refund, or re-credit of Tokens/Credits.

                        If Tokens/Credits are consumed but no Output is delivered due to a verified technical error on the Provider's side (e.g., a system failure preventing completion/delivery), the Provider may, at its discretion and subject to applicable law, either (a) re-credit the consumed Tokens/Credits or (b) provide a re-run, provided that you notify the Provider as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of the issue (and, where possible, no later than 14 days) using the support channels described in Section 21 (Contact Information), and provide sufficient information to enable verification (e.g., your account identifier, date/time of the attempt, transaction reference, and a brief description of the issue and/or screenshots). The Provider may request additional information reasonably necessary to investigate and confirm the technical failure. Nothing in this Section limits any mandatory consumer rights or remedies that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

Any price changes apply prospectively and do not affect purchases already completed. The price displayed in the applicable checkout flow (or Service interface) at the time you confirm payment is the price that applies to that transaction.
