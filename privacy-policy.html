                    <p class="section-text">
                        For avoidance of doubt, cookies are primarily a Website technology. Interactions within the Bot are governed by Telegram's platform capabilities and settings. Where similar tracking technologies are used in connection with the Website or other Provider-operated applications, this Section applies.
